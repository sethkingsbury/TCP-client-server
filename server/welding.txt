WELDING-Wire
      M.I.G.(Metal Inert Gas) - Points to Remember

      1. Mig (GMAW) welding is often referred to
         by the manufacturer's trade name as Micro-wire,
         Aircomatic, Sigma, and Millermatic Welding.

      2. Mig welding is faster than stick electrode
         welding and is much easier to learn.

      3. Spray transfer type of welding is particu-
         larly adapted for welding heavy gage metals.

      4. Short circuiting transfer welding is best
         for welding light gage metals.

      5. For optimum efficiency, DCRP current is
         required for Mig welding.

      6. For  Mig  welding, a constant  potentiaI
         power supply with a nearly flat volt-ampere char-
         acteristic produces the best results.

      7. As a general rule, an air-cooled gun  is
         satisfactory  when  welding  with  amperage
         around 200 and a water-cooled gun for welding
         heavy metals requiring higher amperages.

      8. The use of CO2 as a shielding gas is most
         effective and less expensive when welding steel.

      9. Argon or a mixture of argon and oxygen
         will produce the most effective results in welding
         aluminum and stainless steel.

     10. The rate of gas flow for welding most
         metals is approximately 35 cu ft/hr. However,
         this rate may have to be varied somewhat, de-
         pending on the type, electrode size, and thick-
         ness of metal.
